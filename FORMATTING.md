The best place to learn more about how to format markdown (files ending in .md) is to refer to the Github documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

The documentation describes how to create headings, create bulleted lists, style text, include images, and many other things.
